System info
===========

This is a build script for the repair.img initramfs used for emergency
repair on Arachsys machines. Build with 'build' and verify with 'test'
if firecracker and ../guest/boot/linux are available.

To boot from the UEFI shell, use

  linux.efi initrd=repair.img quiet

Including the 'quiet' argument helps prevent kernel messages flooding
the console while it is in interactive use.

Exiting from the sulogin shell will automatically reboot the host after
attempting to cleanly shutdown any filesystems still mounted.
