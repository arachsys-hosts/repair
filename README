System info
===========

This is a build script for a repair.zst initramfs used for emergency repair
when developing Arachsys Linux machines. Build with 'build' and verify with
'test' if hyper and ../guest/boot/linux are available.

To boot from the UEFI shell, use

  linux.efi initrd=repair.zst quiet

Including the 'quiet' argument helps prevent kernel messages flooding
the console while it is in interactive use. Multiple console arguments
can be given to the kernel: if so, repair.zst will start a shell on all
of them rather than just the last console listed.

When maintenance is complete, reboot or power down the host with 'reboot'
or 'poweroff' in the usual way, which will attempt to cleanly shutdown
any filesystems still mounted. Exiting from the maintenance shell will
spawn a new one to avoid leaving the machine in an unresponsive state.
